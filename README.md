Here I demonstrate how to use Azure to reset passwords.

Starting off, you must enter the **Microsoft Entra Admin Center**, scroll to **Users**, and hit the arrow for **All Users**.

You will then select the user's name and click **Reset Password**. This will allow the user to receive a temporary password. On their next sign-in, they will be able to change this password.
